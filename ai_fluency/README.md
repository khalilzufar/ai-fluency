# AI Fluency portfolio package

This folder contains the AI Fluency work built around a measured machine-learning case study.
The public showcase is deployed at:

<https://khalilzufar.github.io/ai-fluency-portfolio/>

## What is included

- `workflows/automation_workflow.md` — a repeatable research-to-story workflow with prompts, five dry runs, time-saved estimates, and failure points.
- `agent/` — a standard-library personal agent with a small tool registry, a live public-page fetch tool, design notes, and a raw run capture.
- `mcp/agent_concepts.md` — a plain-language workflow/agent/MCP explainer and three tool-call examples.
- `website/` — build notes, DNS walkthrough, responsive QA, self-review, break testing, analytics boundary, retrospective, and hours log.
- `submissions/ai_fluency_map.md` — a map from each remaining portal item to its evidence.

## Public-safe boundary

The site uses only public project information and public repository links. It does not expose email, client names, private queries, domains, credentials, or raw warehouse exports. The optional analytics instrumentation is first-party and local-only; no third-party analytics account or tracking identifier is claimed.

## Run locally

```powershell
python ai_fluency/agent/personal_agent.py --query "What should I improve next?"
python ai_fluency/agent/personal_agent.py --query "Check the public paper" --site-url https://khalilzufar.github.io/FlyRank-ML/
```

The portfolio itself is static and can be served from the repository root with any static server. GitHub Pages publishes `docs/` from `main`.
